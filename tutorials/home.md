# Data Structures and Algorithms

Data Structure and Algorithms (DSA) is a fundamental part of Computer Science that teaches you how to think and solve complex problems systematically.

Using the right DSA makes your program run faster, especially when working with lots of data.

## This Project

This repository is made to help me in learn DSA fast and easy, because always I return to solve my demps.

First I explain the fundamentals of DSA: understanding different data structures, basic algorithm concepts, and how they are used in programming.

Then, I explain more about xomplex DSA like trees and graphs, study advanced sorting and searching algorithms, explore concepts like time and size complexity.

## The codes

Althrough DSA is actually not specifc to any programming language, all algorithms are made with C, CPP and Py (the best choice to learn is C/CPP because you need to manage pointers and memory, other languages abstract this part a lot).
